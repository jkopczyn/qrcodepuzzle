I played a particular puzzle from the Simon Tatham collection and it occurred to me that you could *probably* turn an arbitrary QR code into a valid solvable puzzle of that type, by setting the error correction level high and then fuzzing enough to make the puzzle work but not so much that it breaks the QR Code. Trying to automate that transformation and verification is the point of this repository.
